This script is mainly for Bee Swarm macroing, which checks for the strange HTTP error message on ROBLOX, presses retry, and the Natro macro will automatically restart. I have no idea why this happened during Beesmas. This weird error appears to occur only on ROBLOX; other websites are fine (the fact that if you use multiple ROBLOX instances, this error still appears even when one is running is odd. The router is useless).

Usage: Run the script, click start, and run your Natro macro.
Commands used:
- `netsh int ip reset`
- `ipconfig /release`
- `ipconfig /renew`
- `ipconfig /flushdns` - While running, one should still work, but sometimes it doesn't.
Behavior: Check for errors every minute. Perform commands if found, then retry.
Run requirements:
- A 2K monitor (2550x1440 recommended).
- Python
- VSCode with the Python extension
Check for any errors (the yellow line in the import section), mostly related to numpy or tkinter. Run `pip install package_name` after the import (e.g., if you import tkinter as tk, run `pip install tkinter`).
Change the directory of 2 files to yours (copy as path).
You can manually run these commands by executing `flushdns.bat`.
Other options: reboot the router, PC (rebooting the PC usually fixes it, but it may recur after a few minutes), or reinstall Windows.
Users: Those experiencing this while macroing, having ROBLOX issues, or facing delayed internet connections (taking 15 seconds to get a 3ms ping, then continuously getting the same ping every second).
