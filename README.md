This script is mainly for Bee Swarm macroing, which checks for the strange HTTP error message on ROBLOX, presses retry, and the Natro macro will automatically restart.

Usage: Run the script, click start, and run your Natro macro.

Commands used:
- `netsh int ip reset`
- `ipconfig /release`
- `ipconfig /renew`
- `ipconfig /flushdns` - While running, one should still work, but sometimes it doesn't.
Behavior: Check for errors every minute. Perform commands if found, then retry.

Run requirements:
- A 2K monitor (2550x1440 recommended).
- Python
- VSCode with the Python extension
- 
Check for any errors (the yellow line in the import section), mostly related to numpy or tkinter. Run `pip install package_name` after the import (e.g., if you import tkinter as tk, run `pip install tkinter`).

Change the directory of 2 files to yours (copy as path).

You can manually run these commands by executing `flushdns.bat`.

Other options: reboot the router, PC (rebooting the PC usually fixes it, but it may recur after a few minutes), or reinstall Windows.

Users: Those experiencing this while macroing, having ROBLOX issues, or facing delayed internet connections (taking 15 seconds to get a 3ms ping, then continuously getting the same ping every second).

Please note that there are times when it may not work, especially if the Retry button contains dots around or dark mode,etc.
